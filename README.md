1. Project name: Aprolis Dossin in France

This was a big project with 11 Very Narrow Aisle (VNA) vehicles. It was kind of a training project for me to work with our Senior System Engineer. This project
was a good opportunity for me to understand the system design, the complex VNA vehicle, testing methods, Safety systems and our vehicle Software codebase. i spent
2 weeks on this site. In this project, I did vehicle tuning, safety test, Rocla's Pallet Finder tuning and testing which later helped to create the Instruction documentation on How to properly adjust the Pallet Finder. I also did the documentation on the adjustment instruction of the VNA vehicle. This included the Mast Adjustment, Height Adjustment, Drive and Steer Encoder adjustment, Pallet Finder adjustment, Carriage and lateral encoder adjustmnets etc.

2. Project Name: BMI Jessen in Germany

This was my first project alone. The site was already in production. I was there to make some modifications requested by customer. It included conveyor handshakes, Fire alarm test, Maintenance station programming, troubleshooting, Layout changes and Operator training. The challenging part in this project was to design the Fire alarm. Customer wanted custom behaviour of the AGVs when the Fire Alarm was on. Also customer wanted that the AGV will finish the delivery before moving to a specific space. As the area was very narrow and there were fire doors which needed space clearance, the design was a bit challenging.

3. Project Name: Carl Macher GMB in Germany

This is one of the most challenging projects I was involved in. It was 6 AWT vehicles with pallet finder. I took over this site from another Commissioning Engineer and had to do a lot of things from scratch again. I did a lot of troubleshooting, layout modifications, SW changes, I/O handshaking with third party conveyor system and operator training. I spent 6 weeks on this site on and off to complete the project. The load type was reels of paper on top of Euro pallets which created a lot of challenges for the pallet finder. There was also additional challenge that at night time AGVs were operating without any operator. So we needed to design a way that if error happens to one AGV, Other AGVs can still continue without getting blocked. 

4. Project Name: Bring in Norway

This was an old VNA vehicle project in Norway where 10 old vehicles were already running. New project included 2 new VNA vehicles. This was challenging as the dimension of the new vehicle were different than the old ones and fitting the new vehicles in old layout was kind of challenging. Also the rack beam finder sensor from Sick used in old vehicles were out of production and new generation sensors were included in the new vehicles. I spent 40 days in Norway to complete the project. The most difficult challenge was the adjustment of the Sick rack beam finder sensor. There were four different aisle sizes and I needed to configure the sensor so that it works in all the aisles flawlessly. 

5. Project Name: Betatex in Italy

This was in a small scale warehouse with a mixed system of 2 ATX and 2 VNA vehicles. This was my first project with Rocla FleetController system(In house SW for controlling traffic, vehicle allocation, Visualization, Order optimization etc.). I did some design work in the office alongside our Senior System Engineer. On site, I did Reflector survey, vehicle tuning, layout adjustments, vehicle SW bug reports & modifications, Charger installations and programming with Beckhoff PLC, I/O handshake testing with wrapper conveyor & fire doors etc. I spent 50 days on site on and off to complete the project. The challenge in this project was VNA vehicles changing aisles quite often which in not the case in general. 

6. Project Name: AstraZeneca in Sweden

This was the last commissioning project I was involved in. This is a 7 ATX vehicle system. I spent 9 days on site to help Commissioning Engineer to find vehicle issues 
and SW bugs. In this project, I found a critical bug in our base software regarding the Li-Ion battery control and AGV switch off program(to save the battery) which was later added to the next base SW release and also SW update in existing projects.
